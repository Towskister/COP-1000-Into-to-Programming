Summary
In this lab, you use what you have learned about parallel lists to complete a partially completed Python program.

The program should either print the name and price for a coffee add-in from the Jumpinâ€™ Jive Coffee Shop or it should print the message "Sorry, we do not carry that.".

Read the problem description carefully before you begin. The data file provided for this lab includes the necessary input statements. You need to write the part of the program that searches for the name of the coffee add-in(s) and either prints the name and price of the add-in or prints the error message if the add-in is not found. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.
