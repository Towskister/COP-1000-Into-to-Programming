PART I: Functions – Math Test

Write the Flowchart and Python code for the following programming problem based on the pseudocode below.

Write a program that will allow a student to enter their name and then ask them to solve 10 mathematical equations.  The program should display two random numbers that are to be added, such as:

  247
+ 129

The program should allow the student to enter the answer.  The program should then display whether the answer was right or wrong, and accumulate the correct values.  After the 10 questions are asked, calculate the average correct.  Then display the student name, the number correct, and the average correct in both decimal and percentage format.

In addition to any system functions you may use, you might consider the following functions:

1)	A function that allows the student to enter their name.

2)	A function that gets two random numbers, anywhere from 1 to 500.

3)	A function that displays the equation and asks the user to enter their answer.

4)	A function that checks to see if the answer is right and accumulates the number right.

5)	A function that calculates the results.

6)	A function that displays the student name, the number right, and the average right.

Your sample output might look as follows (random numbers will be different):

Enter Student Name: Katie
What is the answer to the following equation
424
+
28
What is the sum: 472
Wrong

What is the answer to the following equation
163
+
233
What is the sum: 396
Right

What is the answer to the following equation
285
+
453
What is the sum: 688
Wrong

Etc…(through 10 iterations)

Information for student:  Katie
The number right:  5
The average right is 0.50 or 50.0 %
