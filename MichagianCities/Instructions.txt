Summary
In this lab, you use what you have learned about searching a list to find an exact match to complete a partially prewritten Python program.

The program uses a list that contains valid names for 10 cities in Michigan. You ask the user to enter a city name; your program then searches the list for that city name. If it is not found, the program should print a message that informs the user the city name is not found in the list of valid cities in Michigan.

The starter file provided for this lab includes input statements. You need to write code to examine all the items in the list and test for a match. You also need to determine if you should print the "Not a city in Michigan." message.

Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

Instructions
Study the prewritten code to make sure you understand it.
Write a loop statement that examines the names of cities stored in the list.
