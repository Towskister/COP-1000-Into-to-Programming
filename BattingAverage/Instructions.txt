Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially prewritten Python program that uses a list.

The program prompts the user to interactively enter eight batting averages, which the program stores in an array. It should then find the minimum and maximum batting averages stored in the array, as well as the average of the eight batting averages. The data file provided for this lab includes the input statement and some variable declarations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

Instructions
Make sure the file BattingAverage.py is selected and open.
Write the Python statements as indicated by the comments.
Execute the program by clicking the Run button at the bottom of the screen. Enter the following batting averages: .299, .157, .242, .203, .198, .333, .270, .190. The minimum batting average should be .157 and the maximum batting average should be .333. The average should be .2365.
