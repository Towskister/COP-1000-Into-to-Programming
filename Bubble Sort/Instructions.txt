Bubble Sort

Summary
In this lab, you will complete a Python program that uses a list to store data for the village of Marengo.

The village of Marengo conducted a census and collected records that contain household data, including the number of occupants in each household. The exact number of household records has not yet been determined, but you know that Marengo has fewer than 300 households.

The program is described in Chapter 8, Exercise 5, in Programming Logic and Design. The program should allow the user to enter each household size and determine the mean and median household size in Marengo. The program should output the mean and median household size in Marengo. The file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable declarations and input statements. You need to write the code that sorts the household sizes in ascending order using a bubble sort, and then prints the mean and median household size in Marengo. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

Instructions
Make sure that the file HouseholdSize.py is selected and open.
Write the bubble sort.
Calculate the total of the household size.
Output the mean and median household size in Marengo.
Execute the program by clicking the Run button and the bottom of the screen.
Enter the following input, and ensure the output is correct. Household sizes: 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6 followed by 999 to exit the program.
