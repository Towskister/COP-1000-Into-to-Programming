You are going to code the game of craps.

_____________________________________________________________________________

1. You will create 2 dice to roll. You will include a graphic of the dice for each roll.

2. On the first roll, if the dice total a 7 or 11 you win, print to the screen"You win",

3. If the dice total 2, 3, 12 you lose, print to the screen "You lose".

4. Any other number you keep rolling until you win or lose.

5. You can include a loop to prompt for ending or continuing the game so you do not have to rerun the program.

6. When you exit the game, print to the screen the number of wins and loses.

A return value of 1 means you win, a return value of 0 means you lost. You can use a different variable to keep track of your wins and loses.
